# Final Class!

//TODO mention sth about how the data is raw

Now that you've been through the entire course, we want to reinforce some of the skills that you've learned by applying your knowledge to several existing datasets and have you go through the wrangling, analysis, and visualization process as much as you can on your own. By the end of this lesson, you should have ... //TODO \[some code that shows...\]

For each of these datasets (as many as time allows), we'd like you to do some basic analysis, including the following steps:

1.  Create a directory for the analysis of this dataset, using best practices discussed in the previous class.
2.  Load in the data.
3.  Perform some initial data exploration (What are the rows? What are the columns? How many samples does this dataset have? etc.)
4.  Identify at least 1 research question that you could try to answer with this dataset.
5.  Format the data in a way that allows for this analysis.
6.  Visualize the data in helpful ways to answer your question.
7.  Make your code reproducible by using Github.

To help with your analyses, we have included a **template document** outlining these steps that you are welcome to use.

//TODO more pointers for what to do for analyses, 1-2 example figs/analyses, more decripts of the data structure, so the teacher doesnt have to be super familiar with the data. crunchy fig. prob this is mostly going to be a "here's a figure - recreate it". def need to include some code to copy/paste for certain operations

# Datasets

The csvs are available under the `data` folder (or wherever it'll be moved to). We have provided links to data that is publically available for download, as well as some related publications that may give you more information about the data.

These datasets were chosen because we thought they represented a good variety in the different kinds of wrangling and visualization challenges you might encounter with your own data in the future, and are presented roughly in order of increasing experimental/wrangling complexity. We have highlighted a few specific R skills that some of these datasets were meant to challenge you on.

For each dataset, we have provided a description of the research question/data collection methods, metadata, and the first few lines of each dataset. Read through these descriptions and work on the dataset you find most interesting.

::: {.callout-tip title="But I thought this was HTLTCode, not HTLTScience!"}
To get the most out of today's activities, we highly encourage you practice going through the whole data analysis workflow as independently as you can, developing your own research questions and analysis ideas.

That said, we have prepared some example research questions and figures for each dataset to get everyone started, so you can decide if you'd rather focus more on coding or sciencing for each dataset. These questions are split into "easier" and "harder" coding challenges.

Thus, based on your comfort level, you can decide how much of the data analysis workflow you want to try independently today:

1.  Recreate our figures
2.  Develop your own analysis and figures to answer our research questions
3.  Develop your own research questions, analysis, figures

::: {.callout-note title="Up for a challenge?" collapse="true"}
Some of these datasets come with additional files or have even less pre-processed versions. If you're up for a challenge (or are revisiting this material and feeling more confident in your skills), we have included those csvs for your perusal.

## Western Africa Ebola public health dataset

[Data source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imdevskp/ebola-outbreak-20142016-complete-dataset)

**Skills to practice:** renaming columns, working with dates

**Background:** The Western African Ebola virus (EV) epidemic of 2013-2016 is the most severe outbreak of the EV disease in history. It caused major disruptions and loss of life, mainly in the republics of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone.

How might you represent the dynamics of this outbreak?

-   How many cases and deaths in total were recorded by each country from 2014-2016?

## Harder

-   By country, how did the average number of cases and death change each year?

## Heat exposure in Phoenix, Arizona ecological dataset

[Data source](https://data.sustainability-innovation.asu.edu/cap-portal/metadataviewer?packageid=knb-lter-cap.647.2) \| [Related publication](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2020.106271)

**Skills to practice:** dealing with `NA` values, parsing strings

**Background:** Exposure to extreme heat is of growing concern with the rise of urbanization and ongoing climate change. Though most current knowledge about heat-health risks are known and implemented at the neighborhood level, less is known about individual experiences of heat, which can vary due to differences in access to cooling resources and activity patterns.

To further investigate, the Central Arizona-Pheonix Long-Term Ecological Research Program [(CAP-LTER)](https://sustainability-innovation.asu.edu/caplter/) recruited participants from 5 Pheonix-area neighborhoods to wear air temperature sensors that recorded their individually-experienced temperatures (IETs) as they went about their daily activities.

What kind of relationships can you find between individual activty and neighborhood?

## AVIDA digital evolution dataset

[Related publications](https://avida-ed.msu.edu/digital-evolution/)[^1]

[^1]: In particular, see [Lenski et al. (2003)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature01568) and [Smith et al. (2016)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12052-016-0060-0).

**Skills to practice:** pivoting, working with multiple datasets

**Background:** The following data was generated using [Avida-ED](https://avida-ed.msu.edu/avida-ed-application/), an online educational application that allows one to study the dynamics of evolutionary processes. Digital, asexually-reproducing organisms known as "Avidians" can be placed into something akin to a virtual Petri dish to evolve in, and one can manipulate parameters such as mutation rate, resource availability, and dish size to study how those factors affect the evolution of the population.

Your friend needs your help to analyze their AVIDA-Ed data. They designed a series of experiments around a mutant Avidian that gets an energy bonus when the sugar "nanose" is present and a wildtype Avidian that does not. They wanted to see how competition and resource availability affect the population dynamics of these Avidians.

Your friend grew either the wildtype only, mutant only, or both populations together (competition) in the following 3 environments:

-   Minimal (no additional sugars present)

-   Selective (only nanose present)

-   Rich (nanose and additional sugars present)

```{r dplyr_syntax,echo=FALSE, fig.align = 'center', out.width = "75%", fig.cap = "Avida experiment setup"}
knitr::include_graphics("project-day-2_files/avida-expt.png")
```

Help your friend get started with some of the exploratory data analysis: what interesting patterns can you find between genotype, competition, and resource availability?

All population measurements were determined for `minimal`, `selective`, and `rich` media.

## Easier

-   How does population size change over time for the wildtype or mutant in different medias?
-   What is the relationship between fitness and offspring cost in competition conditions in different medias?

## Harder

-   How does the change in fitness over time compare between different treatment conditions and media types?
-   Which media type allows for the most maximal performance of the wildtype? The mutant? Competition conditions?

*For teachers:* may need to help students with joining dataframes, parsing out column names, pivoting, and hopefully not the biology parts... once the columns are pivoted they can just slap different metrics on there. can plot time series data.
