### Prep & lesson goals

There will be a bit of prep work on your end for this class because this is so open-ended: would strongly encourage being somewhat familiar with the background and data overview sections before class. These shouldn't be terribly tricky datasets for instructors to work with, and you don't really need to understand the science (except maybe the Avida data): just know enough that you could tell a student "that figure/analysis makes sense and is informative", have some intuition of what is making their code break, etc.

Ideally, students can just read up on what each dataset contains, come up with questions, and happily work their way through it and make some beautiful figures with no issues :-) That said, the ultimate goal for this lesson is that students will leave today with a repo containing a mostly done analysis (data, cleaning script, analysis script, final figs, etc). This is structured to be a bit flexible to match different science/coding comfort levels, so students can decide if they want to do the whole workflow themselves (develop questions, analysis, figs), do only parts of it (create their own figs), or just practice the coding (recreate a figure from the raw data).

### Tips & ideas for running the lesson

btw, you can pretty off-script for this lesson (i.e. use different datasets, create different analyses, etc): again, the goal is just for students to really synthesize the lessons, put them into practice, and try to work independently. At base, stress this aspect, and if you choose to follow the script, probably at least read over the "skills to practice" and the "background" sections before letting everyone off on their own.

To make the work easier, you could have people work in pairs (but in their own repos). You could maybe have them work in larger groups/have everyone do the same analysis, but it might feel too much like data viz day 2...

There will be some pre-filled project templates in the folder that goes through the whole process for 1 easy and 1 hard question for each dataset (which will stress the specific "skills to practice" for each dataset). You can reiterate to the class that for those who want a bit more structure/support, you will be most familiar with the details for those questions (i.e. they should try to recreate those scripts on their own because you'll have the "answer").

Other things:

-   re: "easier" and "harder" questions, those divisions are mostly based off how much data processing is involved and don't have a single answer in mind. Obviously those aren't the only questions you can make for the datasets, so feel free to come up with more.

-   some "Hints" are provided for code that might not have been covered yet (e.g. splitting strings).

//TODO mention sth about how the data is raw

Now that you've been through the entire course, we want to reinforce some of the skills that you've learned by applying your knowledge to several existing datasets and have you go through the wrangling, analysis, and visualization process as much as you can on your own. By the end of this lesson, you should have ... //TODO \[some code that shows...\]

For each of these datasets (as many as time allows), we'd like you to do some basic analysis, including the following steps:

1.  Create a directory for the analysis of this dataset, using best practices discussed in the previous class.
2.  Load in the data.
3.  Perform some initial data exploration (What are the rows? What are the columns? How many samples does this dataset have? etc.)
4.  Identify at least 1 research question that you could try to answer with this dataset.
5.  Format the data in a way that allows for this analysis.
6.  Visualize the data in helpful ways to answer your question.
7.  Make your code reproducible by using Github.

To help with your analyses, we have included a **template document** outlining these steps that you are welcome to use.

//TODO more pointers for what to do for analyses, 1-2 example figs/analyses, more decripts of the data structure, so the teacher doesnt have to be super familiar with the data. crunchy fig. prob this is mostly going to be a "here's a figure - recreate it". def need to include some code to copy/paste for certain operations

# Datasets

The csvs are available under the `data` folder (or wherever it'll be moved to). We have provided links to data that is publically available for download, as well as some related publications that may give you more information about the data.

These datasets were chosen because we thought they represented a good variety in the different kinds of wrangling and visualization challenges you might encounter with your own data in the future, and are presented roughly in order of increasing experimental/wrangling complexity. We have highlighted a few specific R skills that some of these datasets were meant to challenge you on.

For each dataset, we have provided a description of the research question/data collection methods, metadata, and the first few lines of each dataset. Read through these descriptions and work on the dataset you find most interesting.

::: {.callout-tip title="But I thought this was HTLTCode, not HTLTScience!"}
To get the most out of today's activities, we highly encourage you practice going through the whole data analysis workflow as independently as you can, developing your own research questions and analysis ideas.

That said, we have prepared some example research questions and figures for each dataset to get everyone started, so you can decide if you'd rather focus more on coding or sciencing for each dataset. These questions are split into "easier" and "harder" coding challenges.

Thus, based on your comfort level, you can decide how much of the data analysis workflow you want to try independently today:

1.  Recreate our figures
2.  Develop your own analysis and figures to answer our research questions
3.  Develop your own research questions, analysis, figures
:::

::: {.callout-note title="Up for a challenge?" collapse="true"}
Some of these datasets come with additional files or have even less pre-processed versions. If you're up for a challenge (or are revisiting this material and feeling more confident in your skills), we have included those csvs for your perusal.

## Heat exposure in Phoenix, Arizona ecological dataset

[Data source](https://data.sustainability-innovation.asu.edu/cap-portal/metadataviewer?packageid=knb-lter-cap.647.2) \| [Related publication](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2020.106271)

**Skills to practice:** dealing with `NA` values, parsing strings

**Background:** Exposure to extreme heat is of growing concern with the rise of urbanization and ongoing climate change. Though most current knowledge about heat-health risks are known and implemented at the neighborhood level, less is known about individual experiences of heat, which can vary due to differences in access to cooling resources and activity patterns.

To further investigate, the Central Arizona-Pheonix Long-Term Ecological Research Program [(CAP-LTER)](https://sustainability-innovation.asu.edu/caplter/) recruited participants from 5 Pheonix-area neighborhoods to wear air temperature sensors that recorded their individually-experienced temperatures (IETs) as they went about their daily activities.

What kind of relationships can you find between individual activty and neighborhood?

## AVIDA digital evolution dataset

[Related publications](https://avida-ed.msu.edu/digital-evolution/)[^1]

[^1]: In particular, see [Lenski et al. (2003)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature01568) and [Smith et al. (2016)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12052-016-0060-0).

**Skills to practice:** pivoting, working with multiple datasets

**Background:** The following data was generated using [Avida-ED](https://avida-ed.msu.edu/avida-ed-application/), an online educational application that allows one to study the dynamics of evolutionary processes. Digital, asexually-reproducing organisms known as "Avidians" can be placed into something akin to a virtual Petri dish to evolve in, and one can manipulate parameters such as mutation rate, resource availability, and dish size to study how those factors affect the evolution of the population.

Your friend needs your help to analyze their AVIDA-Ed data. They designed a series of experiments around a mutant Avidian that gets an energy bonus when the sugar "nanose" is present and a wildtype Avidian that does not. They wanted to see how competition and resource availability affect the population dynamics of these Avidians.

Your friend grew either the wildtype only, mutant only, or both populations together (competition) in the following 3 environments:

-   Minimal (no additional sugars present)

-   Selective (only nanose present)

-   Rich (nanose and additional sugars present)

```{r dplyr_syntax,echo=FALSE, fig.align = 'center', out.width = "75%", fig.cap = "Avida experiment setup"}
knitr::include_graphics("project-day-2_files/figs/avida-expt.png")
```

Help your friend get started with some of the exploratory data analysis: what interesting patterns can you find between genotype, competition, and resource availability?

*For teachers:* may need to help students with joining dataframes, parsing out column names, pivoting, and hopefully not the biology parts... once the columns are pivoted they can just slap different metrics on there. can plot time series data.
