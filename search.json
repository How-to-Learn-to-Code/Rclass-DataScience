We want to improve rigor and reproducibility in science by providing programming resources and experiences to scientists and professionals in all levels of their careers. Our classes are small-group based courses with a teacher:student ratio that allows the students to learn dynamically and independently. During classes, students are able to follow along with the teacher leading the instruction, or work with one of our floating teachers to troubleshoot or to better understand their own code.\nThis is our curriculum for learning R programming in the context of data analysis. Our curriculum development team has worked tirelessly to develop this new curriculum. We are constantly improving and updating our curricula, so if you’re interested in contributing or have suggestions, please visit https://howtolearntocode.web.unc.edu/ for our most up-to-date contact information.

Whenever someone says they are “on Longleaf” or “running code on Longleaf” it means their personal computer is connected to the cluster and they are either actively interacting with a program running on the cluster (we will be doing this with R Studio!) or writing code that tells the cluster to perform certain tasks whenever it has the memory availability.\nBefore the first class, you will need to request access to Longleaf. Follow the instructions on the Research IT website. In addition to your onyen and email address, you’ll need the following information:\n\nPreferred shell: bash\nFaculty sponsor name and onyen: You can put your PI here, or if you do not have a PI, leave blank.\nType of subscription: Longleaf\nDescription of work you will do on the cluster: How to Learn to Code R class\n\nIt may take ~24 hours before your account is approved.",

You will need to have your Longleaf account approved before accessing OnDemand.\nTo launch OnDemand, navigate to this site in a browser of your choice: https://ondemand.rc.unc.edu (you may want to bookmark this site, you’ll be accessing it for each class).\nOnce you’ve logged in, you’ll see a page like this. Click on the RStudio Server tile.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will take you to a page where you can fill out some parameters for your R Studio Server session. The only one you’ll need to adjust is “Number of hours” where you should put “2”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou can request up to 10 hours, but it’s good practice to only request the amount of time you’ll need (Longleaf is a shared resource!). Since each class is 90 minutes, you’ll likely only need to request 2 hours for each class. Under “Additional job submission arguments” you adjust the amount of memory requested. This won’t be needed for How to Learn to Code classes, but may be needed when you are running your own analyses on large datasets in the future.\n\n\nAfter you’ve filled out the appropriate information, click Launch. This will take you to the “My Interactive Sessions” page. Your session request may be queued for a minute while space on the cluster is being allocated for your session. Once it’s ready, click “Connect to R Studio Server”. This will launch R Studio in a new tab.",

    "text": "Navigating R Studio\nYour R Studio window is divided into four panes. You can adjust the sizes of each pane (horizontally and vertically) by dragging the outer edges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou may only see three panes when you first launch R Studio. If that’s the case, go to File &gt; New File &gt; R Script.\n\n\n\n\n\nimage: https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/ui/ui-panes.html\n\n\nThe top left pane is called the Source and this is where you will be writing and editing code. Writing code here does not automatically execute or run it. To do that, you will need to use the Console pane in the bottom left. There are a few ways to get code written in the Source pane to the Console pane, in order from least efficient to most efficient:\n\nCopying the line of code you want to run and pasting it into the console and then hitting the “return” or “enter” key.\nPutting your cursor anywhere in the line of code you want to run and clicking “Run” in the upper right section of the Source pane\nHighlighting the line of code (or section of code) you want to run and clicking “Run” in the upper right section of the Source pane\nPutting your cursor anywhere in the line of code you want to run, highlighting the line of code, or highlighting the section of code you want to run and pressing Alt + Enter (for PC) or cmd + return (for Mac)\n\nAny code written in the console is not saved anywhere. Generally, people write their code in the Source pane, and then run it as needed in the Console. This is important to remember when writing reproducible code–all code needed to run your analyses, generate plots, etc. should be written in the source (which is then saved as an R script). Throughout this course, you will likely want to ensure that the code you write during each class is saved in a separate R script.\nThe Environments pane shows current saved objects, but also has tabs to show history (all commands executed in your current session) and connections (if you connect to any local or remote databases). You will almost exclusively be using the Environment tab. The Output pane is in the bottom right and shows outputs of code such as plots. It also has tabs for files (an interactive file explorer), packages (which shows currently installed R packages), and help (which shows package documentation). You will likely be using the Plots and Help tabs the most.",

    "section": "Talking like an R user",
    "text": "Talking like an R user\nBelow is some jargon that you may hear during class. Don’t worry about memorizing it all before Class 1! Just know that it’s here so if you are ever wondering what a term means you will know where to look.\nRunning code/run this line/execute: Telling R to perform the command given in a console. If someone says “run this line of code” that means to send it to the console (either by copying/pasting or using one of the shortcuts mentioned previously).\nData types: Data types in R include numeric, logical, and character. There are a few more, but those are the main three. We will touch on these more in Classes 1 and 2.\nVector: A series of values of any data type. A vector is created using the c() function (c for combine/concatenate).\nFactors: This is the R term for categorical data. Sometimes R will automatically treat data as categorical (especially if it is a character type), but not always. You can coerce other data types (like numeric) to factors using using the factor() function and specifying the order using the levels argument. For more information on factors, see this page in the R for Data Science book.\nData frame: The best way to think of data frames is a spreadsheet. Technically, they are composed of vectors. Typically the rows in a data frame will correspond to observations and the columns will correspond to variables describing those observations. Data in a data frame can be of different types–i.e. you can have one column be character (maybe describing hair color for each observation) and another be numeric (maybe describing height for each observation).\nMatrix: A matrix in R is very similar to a data frame. Unlike a data frame, all elements must be of the same data type.\nFunctions: A function performs a given task. This task can be very simple (add two numbers) or more complex (create a large data frame, run a linear regression, save the output to a csv file). R has many built-in functions you will use. Many packages also have functions you can use.\nPackages: Packages in R are extensions of what is called “base R.” Base R refers to using R without any add-ons (i.e., no packages). Packages can have data, functions, and/or compiled code. It is the responsibility of package developers to maintain their package–which means some undergo frequent updates and some haven’t been touched in years (and thus might not work anymore for whatever reason). It also means that some packages can have bugs or might not be appropriate for your data/analysis. To use a package, you will first need to install it using the function install.package(\"&lt;package_name&gt;\"). You will only need to install the package once. Each time you want to use the package, you’ll need to load it into your environment: library(&lt;package_name'). Once it is loaded into your environment, you will be able to use any functions or data in the package.\nglobal vs. local: Global refers to something (usually a variable) that is accessible to the entire program/code. Local refers to something (usually a variable) that is accessible only relative to something else (such as within a specific code block, like a function).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndirectory: A directory is another term for what you may refer to as a “folder” on your computer.\npaths: Paths are the directions to files and folders on your system. Understanding paths is important for reading your data into your R environment, since you will need to tell R where the file is located. You can have global and local paths. Global paths are sort of like the full set of instructions starting from your home base. Local paths are instructions given a certain starting location. Here’s an example of a global path to an example file on Longleaf: /work/users/g/h/goheels/my_project/my_data.csv. Here’s an example of a local path, given the starting spot of the goheels directory: my_project/my_data.csv.\nsyntax/style: The visual appearance (spaces, indentations, capitalization) of your code greatly improves readability and makes it easier for someone else to quickly understand what it’s doing (or you six months later). In this class, we will follow the Tidyverse Style Guide and encourage you to reference it during class to ensure you are consistently naming variables and using appropriate syntax. The sections most relevant for now are Files, Syntax, and the “Comments” section of the Functions page. Later classes will touch on pipes and ggplot2.\nConditionals: A conditional is a line of code that will run only if a particular condition is met. You can recognize these by the use of “if” “else” or “while”. The best way to understand these is by actually reading the code out loud. If you were to read the below example out loud, you might say “if x equals 3, print ‘condition is met’, else print ‘condition is not met’”. What do you think will happen if x == 3? What if x == 4?\n\nif(x == 3) {\n  print(\"condition is met\")\n} else {\n  print(\"condition is not met\")\n}",

Sometimes these are OK to ignore, sometimes they indicate an issue you need to look into further. Either way, they should always be investigated! “Errors” are fatal issues and may be the result of things like syntax errors, typos, and incorrect data types.

Remember that you are responsible for understanding what your code is doing and why, and that the output is accurate.

For the following examples we will use a built-in dataset in R called “iris” that has some measurements across a few species of flowers. It is one of the most popular built-in datasets in R. We will use this dataset to explore key coding concepts: variables, data types, and functions.\nFirst, let’s take a look at the dataset. You can view the dataset multiple ways. Let’s try one–copy the below line of code into your console and run it.\n\niris\n\nAs we can see, this dataset has a few columns of numbers, in addition to the species. Let’s try a few other ways to look at this dataset. As you try each method, think about what is different about each method. When would one method be more beneficial than another?\n\nhead(iris)\n\n  Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species\n1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa\n2          4.9         3.0          1.4         0.2  setosa\n3          4.7         3.2          1.3         0.2  setosa\n4          4.6         3.1          1.5         0.2  setosa\n5          5.0         3.6          1.4         0.2  setosa\n6          5.4         3.9          1.7         0.4  setosa\n\n\n\n#View(iris)\n\nYou are probably already thinking of questions you need the answers to in order to familiarize yourself with this dataset. What does each row represent? Each column? How many observations (rows) do we have? What is the average petal length? Think about other questions you may want to ask. Think about how you would go about answering those questions with what you already know. Maybe you’d count each row on your screen to get the number of observations, or copy the values under Petal.Length into your phone calculator to calculate the mean. By the end of this class, you’ll be able to do all those things very quickly in R!",

    "text": "Converting Data Types\nFor example, sometimes when we read in data from a file, numbers can appear as strings of characters rather than a “numeric” type.\n\nmy_numbers &lt;- c(\"4\", \"2\", \"7\", \"10\")\nprint(my_numbers)\n\n[1] \"4\"  \"2\"  \"7\"  \"10\"\n\n\nHow can we tell? Because the numbers above are in quotations, indicating that they are of the character type and R is interpreting them as text. Before doing any math or further analysis with these data points, it’s a good idea to convert them to the numeric type first.\n\nmy_numbers &lt;- as.numeric(my_numbers)\nprint(my_numbers)\n\n[1]  4  2  7 10\n\n\nNote that the quotations are now gone. Now, we can do basic (or more advanced) calculations like the ones below.\n\n# Get minimum out of a list of values\nmin(my_numbers)\n\n[1] 2\n\n\n\n# Get maximum out of a list of values\nmax(my_numbers)\n\n[1] 10\n\n\n\n# Get average (mean) out of a list of values\nmean(my_numbers)\n\n[1] 5.75\n\n\nWe can also sort this list of values to go from smallest to largest. After doing so, the smallest value will be first in the list and the largest value will be last.\n\nmy_numbers &lt;- sort(my_numbers)\nmy_numbers\n\n[1]  2  4  7 10\n\n\nWe can reverse the order to go from largest to smallest. There is an option using the sort function to do this.\n\nmy_numbers &lt;- sort(my_numbers, decreasing = TRUE)\nmy_numbers\n\n[1] 10  7  4  2",

    "section": "Accessing parts of a list",
    "text": "Accessing parts of a list\nOne thing we’ll be doing a lot of is looking at parts of our data. For example, we might want to look at individual items in a vector. These items could be numbers or characters.\n\nmy_data &lt;- c(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\", \"F\")\nmy_data\n\n[1] \"A\" \"B\" \"C\" \"D\" \"E\" \"F\"\n\n\nIn this case, let’s say I’m really interested in that “E” and want to pull it out separately from the rest of the data. I can do that with “indexing”. Here, I can tell that it’s the 5th item in the list, so I can extract it using the following:\n\nmy_data[5]\n\n[1] \"E\"\n\n\nWe can also extract multiple items. If we wanted “D”, “E”, and “F”, we can get all the values from item 4 (“D”) to item 6 (“F”).\n\nmy_data[4:6]\n\n[1] \"D\" \"E\" \"F\"\n\n\nLet’s say we forgot to include some of our data and now we want to add it to this list. We can update my_data to also include these values.\n\nmy_data &lt;- c(my_data, \"G\", \"H\", \"I\")\nmy_data\n\n[1] \"A\" \"B\" \"C\" \"D\" \"E\" \"F\" \"G\" \"H\" \"I\"\n\n\nBefore we move on, let’s cover creating vectors. We already did this several times above, but didn’t discuss it. Typically, we’ll want to make vectors of numbers (e.g. our data values) or vectors of characters (e.g. labels for our data). Depending on whether we use quotes or not, R will interpret them as either numeric vectors or character vectors.\n\n# Numeric vector\nnumeric_vector &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\nnumeric_vector\n\n[1] 1 2 3 4 5\n\n# Character vector\ncharacter_vector &lt;- c(\"apple\", \"banana\", \"orange\")\ncharacter_vector\n\n[1] \"apple\"  \"banana\" \"orange\"\n\n\nRemember the iris dataset from earlier? Let’s return to it to cover extracting some of the rows or columns from this data.\nWe can access specific columns in one of two ways. Typically, we will want to access it by the name of the column. We do this using the name of the data frame, followed by the dollar sign, and finally the name of the column. For example:\n\niris$Petal.Length\n\n  [1] 1.4 1.4 1.3 1.5 1.4 1.7 1.4 1.5 1.4 1.5 1.5 1.6 1.4 1.1 1.2 1.5 1.3 1.4\n [19] 1.7 1.5 1.7 1.5 1.0 1.7 1.9 1.6 1.6 1.5 1.4 1.6 1.6 1.5 1.5 1.4 1.5 1.2\n [37] 1.3 1.4 1.3 1.5 1.3 1.3 1.3 1.6 1.9 1.4 1.6 1.4 1.5 1.4 4.7 4.5 4.9 4.0\n [55] 4.6 4.5 4.7 3.3 4.6 3.9 3.5 4.2 4.0 4.7 3.6 4.4 4.5 4.1 4.5 3.9 4.8 4.0\n [73] 4.9 4.7 4.3 4.4 4.8 5.0 4.5 3.5 3.8 3.7 3.9 5.1 4.5 4.5 4.7 4.4 4.1 4.0\n [91] 4.4 4.6 4.0 3.3 4.2 4.2 4.2 4.3 3.0 4.1 6.0 5.1 5.9 5.6 5.8 6.6 4.5 6.3\n[109] 5.8 6.1 5.1 5.3 5.5 5.0 5.1 5.3 5.5 6.7 6.9 5.0 5.7 4.9 6.7 4.9 5.7 6.0\n[127] 4.8 4.9 5.6 5.8 6.1 6.4 5.6 5.1 5.6 6.1 5.6 5.5 4.8 5.4 5.6 5.1 5.1 5.9\n[145] 5.7 5.2 5.0 5.2 5.4 5.1\n\n\nIf we knew which column it was (or it wasn’t named), we can also use indexing. Inside the brackets, we will need to indicate which [row , column] we want from this data frame. Since we want all the rows, we will leave the “row” blank. We can see that the Petal.Length was the 3rd column.\n\niris[, 3]\n\n  [1] 1.4 1.4 1.3 1.5 1.4 1.7 1.4 1.5 1.4 1.5 1.5 1.6 1.4 1.1 1.2 1.5 1.3 1.4\n [19] 1.7 1.5 1.7 1.5 1.0 1.7 1.9 1.6 1.6 1.5 1.4 1.6 1.6 1.5 1.5 1.4 1.5 1.2\n [37] 1.3 1.4 1.3 1.5 1.3 1.3 1.3 1.6 1.9 1.4 1.6 1.4 1.5 1.4 4.7 4.5 4.9 4.0\n [55] 4.6 4.5 4.7 3.3 4.6 3.9 3.5 4.2 4.0 4.7 3.6 4.4 4.5 4.1 4.5 3.9 4.8 4.0\n [73] 4.9 4.7 4.3 4.4 4.8 5.0 4.5 3.5 3.8 3.7 3.9 5.1 4.5 4.5 4.7 4.4 4.1 4.0\n [91] 4.4 4.6 4.0 3.3 4.2 4.2 4.2 4.3 3.0 4.1 6.0 5.1 5.9 5.6 5.8 6.6 4.5 6.3\n[109] 5.8 6.1 5.1 5.3 5.5 5.0 5.1 5.3 5.5 6.7 6.9 5.0 5.7 4.9 6.7 4.9 5.7 6.0\n[127] 4.8 4.9 5.6 5.8 6.1 6.4 5.6 5.1 5.6 6.1 5.6 5.5 4.8 5.4 5.6 5.1 5.1 5.9\n[145] 5.7 5.2 5.0 5.2 5.4 5.1\n\n\nLet’s say we didn’t care the exact measurement of the Petal.Length of these flowers.

Using a function in R always follows the same basic format:\nfunction_name(arguments)\nThe arguments are passed to the function, i.e. they are values that the function will manipulate. Functions can be built into R, included in packages, or you can write your own.\nFunctions can do very basic tasks:\n\nprint(\"Hello world!\")\n\n[1] \"Hello world!\"\n\n\nOr more complex tasks, where multiple arguments are required, each separated by a comma:\n\nsubstr(x = \"Hello world!\", start = 2, stop = 4)\n\n[1] \"ell\"\n\n\nWe have already been using functions throughout this class–some examples include sort(), min(), and max().\nWe will be using functions all the time in How to Learn to Code, but for today just know what a function is and what an argument is. Whenever you use a function, it’s important to ensure you understand what it’s doing: are you getting the expected result? Are you using the input arguments correctly? That is not only crucial for learning how to code, but how to think like a coder.",

Before she left, she was working on some interesting analyses of the frequencies of Kens.\n\n\n\nphoto credit: Warner Bros.\n\n\nHere’s the data below, which you will not (and should not) need to change:\n\n# The data -- DO NOT EDIT \nken_data &lt;- data.frame(\n  \"ken_name\" = c(\"Ken1\", \"Ken2\", \"Ken3\", \"Ken4\", \"Ken5\", \"Ken6\", \"Ken7\", \"Allan\"),\n  \"hair_color\" = c(\"Blonde\", \"Brown\", \"Black\", \"Red\", \"Blonde\", \"Brown\", \"Black\", \"Black\"),\n  \"cowboy_hats_owned\" = c(2, 0, 1, 3, 0, 1, 2, 0),\n  \"favorite_outfit\" = c(\"Casual\", \"Formal\", \"Sporty\", \"Beachwear\", \"Formal\", \"Casual\", \"Sporty\", \"Casual\"),\n  \"age\" = c(25, 27, 26, 28, 29, 30, 26, 27),\n  \"height_cm\" = c(180, 175, 182, 178, 180, 183, 177, 175),\n  \"weight_kg\" = c(75, 70, 80, 77, 76, 78, 79, 70),\n  \"favorite_hobby\" = c(\"Surfing\", \"Reading\", \"Soccer\", \"Volleyball\", \"Painting\", \"Cooking\", \"Dancing\", \"Guitar\"),\n  \"favorite_color\" = c(\"Blue\", \"Green\", \"Red\", \"Yellow\", \"Purple\", \"Orange\", \"Pink\", \"Blue\"),\n  \"shoe_size\" = c(10, 9, 11, 10, NA, 11, 10, 9),\n  \"best_friend\" = c(\"Barbie\", \"Barbie\", \"Barbie\", \"Barbie\", \"Barbie\", \"Barbie\", \"Barbie\", NA),\n  \"is_ken\" = c(TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)\n)\n\nHowever, as is typical of Weird Barbie, her code is…weird. In almost all other aspects of life, that’s OK! But when it comes to you, three years later, trying to figure out what she did…not ideal. Here’s her code below.

But it’s not easy to understand what these x and y axes are, so let’s relabel them by changing the parameters xlab and ylab inside the plot() function call\n\n## create a scatterplot with better axes labels\nplot(x = variants$ref.dist, y = variants$query.dist,\n     xlab = \"Reference distance\", ylab = \"Query Distance\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat! We can also add a title and subtitle with main and sub, try this on your own!\nOther plot types:\n\n\n\nFunction\nPlot Type\n\n\n\n\nplot()\nscatterplot\n\n\nlines() or plot(type = \"l\")\nline plot\n\n\n\nTo plot a line on top of points, you can run lines() with the same data immediately following plot(). Notice that the line connects all points, leading to a bit of a jumbled mess. How do you think we can fix this?\n\n## line plot\nplot(x = variants$ref.dist, y = variants$query.dist,\n     xlab = \"Reference distance\", ylab = \"Query Distance\")\nlines(x = variants$ref.dist, y = variants$query.dist)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot\nFor more complex layered plots, we can also use ggplot() from the ggplot2 package. “gg” stands for “grammar of graphics” and plots are built a bit like sentences with different parts building on each other.\nTo start, let’s load in the ggplot2 package. You will only need to do this once.\n\n## load the ggplot2 library\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nNow each time we want to make a plot, you will start by using ggplot().\n\nggplot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe haven’t given this function any data, so right now we just have an empty grey box.\nThe first layer we can add is the data. ggplot() requires the name of the dataset once, then you can just use column names throughout the rest of the code instead of using dataset$var1, dataset$var2, dataset$var3 , etc.\n\nggplot(variants)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe still have a grey box! Although we have told the function we want to use data from the variants dataset, we didn’t tell it which data we want to use. Any time you are referencing a column name to set the position, color, size, etc. of a point, you need to wrap it inside aes(), which is short for “aesthetics”. This looks something like this:\n\nggplot(variants, aes(x = ref.dist, y = query.dist))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than a grey box! Now that we know which variables we are plotting and the dataset they come from, we have the framework to add the next layer: geometry. The geometry, as you might guess, refers to what type of shapes to put on the plot. Is it a line? A point? A bar? For scatterplots, we want the data represented as points, so we will use geom_point().\nWhenever we add a ggplot layer, we will connect it to the current plot using a + sign:\n\nggplot(variants, aes(x = ref.dist, y = query.dist)) +\n  geom_point() # plot as points\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVoila! We have our scatterplot! Now we can continue adding layers to change things like the labels. Use the labs() function to change the x, y, and optionally the title and subtitle:\n\nggplot(variants, aes(x = ref.dist, y = query.dist)) +\n  geom_point() + # plot as points\n  labs(x = \"Reference Distance\",\n       y = \"Query Distance\",\n       title = \"Plot Title\",\n       subtitle = \"Plot Subtitle\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplots will all follow this general formula, changing the geom for different plot types.\nOther plot types:\n\n\n\nFunction\nPlot Type\n\n\n\n\ngeom_point()\nscatterplot\n\n\ngeom_line()\nline plot\n\n\ngeom_smooth()\nline plot of smoothed averages\n\n\n\nTo plot a line on top of points, you can add a second geom, using geom_point() + geom_line().\n\nggplot(variants, aes(x = ref.dist, y = query.dist)) +\n  geom_point() + # plot as points\n  geom_line() + # plot as line\n  labs(x = \"Reference Distance\",\n       y = \"Query Distance\",\n       title = \"Plot Title\",\n       subtitle = \"Plot Subtitle\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(variants, aes(x = ref.dist, y = query.dist)) +\n  geom_smooth() + # plot as smooth line\n  labs(x = \"Reference Distance\",\n       y = \"Query Distance\",\n       title = \"Plot Title\",\n       subtitle = \"Plot Subtitle\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumeric Distribution\nSometimes we want to look at the distribution or spread of values for one continuous variable. For example, in our data, what is the distribution of sizes for our variants?\nThere are several plot types we can use to explore this question\n\n\n\nPlot Type\nBase R Function\nggplot Function\n\n\n\n\nhistogram\nhist()\ngeom_histogram()\n\n\ndensity plot\nplot(density())\ngeom_density()\n\n\nboxplot\nboxplot()\ngeom_boxplot()\n\n\nviolin plot\nnot available\ngeom_violin()\n\n\nbar plot\nbarplot(table())\ngeom_bar(stat = \"identity\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nTry ?function_name() to learn more about the different parameters used to customize each function\n\n\n\nBase R\nIn base R, we can pass each plotting function the vector of values that we want to plot. In this case, we want to plot all of the values in the size column of variants, so we will pass in variants$size to our plotting functions.\n\n## histogram\nhist(variants$size)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## density plot\nplot(density(variants$size))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## boxplot\nboxplot(variants$size)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry adding labels and titles as described before.\n\n\nggplot\nIn ggplot, we start by calling the base ggplot() function with the entire dataset, variants, then we can set the aesthetics of the x value to our column of interest with aes(x = size). Then, we can add unique geoms for each plot type.\n\n## histogram\nggplot(variants, aes(x = size)) +\n  geom_histogram()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## density\nggplot(variants, aes(x = size)) +\n  geom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## boxplot\nggplot(variants, aes(x = size)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## violin plot\nggplot(variants, aes(x = size)) +\n  geom_violin(aes(y = 1)) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# violin plots are meant to compare categories, but we can tell it we only want one plot by setting the aesthetic of `y` to the value 1\n\nTry adding labels and titles described before. You can also easily change the look of ggplots with different themes, try adding theme_ and look at the different autofill options. See more about built-in themes here and more ways to customize themes here.\n\nggplot(variants, aes(x = size)) +\n  geom_density() +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinuous vs Categorical\nSometimes we want to see how the counts or the distribution of a continuous variable change between different categorical groups. Often, we use a barplot for this, but there are several other plot types we can use\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot Type\nBase R Function\nggplot Function\n\n\n\n\nbar plot\nbarplot(name = cat_var, value = cont_var)\ngeom_bar()\n\n\nboxplots\nboxplot(cont_var ~ cat_var)\ngeom_boxplot()\n\n\nviolin plots\nnot available\ngeom_violin()\n\n\n\nwhere cont_var is the continuous variable and cat_var is the categorical variable.\n\nBase R\nIn base R, if we want to plot a numeric by a categorical variable, we will use the ~ symbol to represent “by”\nFor example, if we wanted to plot size by strand, we would do\n\nboxplot(variants$size ~ variants$type)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo make a barplot, we have to first count how many instances there are of each category using the table() function. First, we start with subsetting our data to only the columns we are interested in, then we pass this smaller dataset into the table() function.\n\n# subset all rows, only column \"type\"\nsmallData &lt;- variants[,\"type\"]\nvariantsCount &lt;- table(smallData)\n\nThen, we use the barplot() function, setting the height of bars to the counts in the new table, and the name of the bars to the names of the table. The height of the bars is the total summed size for each variant type.\n\nbarplot(height = variantsCount, names = names(variantsCount))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot\nWhen using ggplot, the total counts per category will be calculated for us. So, we can create a base plot, setting x to the categorical variable and y to the continuous variable, then add +geom_boxplot() to make a boxplot.\n\n## density\nggplot(variants, aes(x = type, y = size)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo make a barplot, we need to give it a bit more information. The height of the barplot is based on certain statistics, such as sum or mean. Since these are summary statistics, we will add stat = \"summary\" and fun = \"mean\" if we want the bar height to relate to the means of each category. How does this compare to the sums?\n\n## boxplot\nggplot(variants, aes(x = type, y = size)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"summary\", fun = \"mean\")",

    "text": "Making plots!\n\nWarm up: numerical by numerical plots\nTo compare two numerical variables, a scatterplot is often the simplest and most effective plotting method. Here, we will compare the flipper length and body mass of our penguins. Remember, the inputs to a scatterplot are the columns of our tibble, which should be numeric, integer, or double vectors. Lets take a look at our data with head() and confirm the datatype with class().\n\nhead(penguins$flipper_length_mm)\n\n[1] 181 186 195  NA 193 190\n\nclass(penguins$flipper_length_mm)\n\n[1] \"integer\"\n\n\n\nggplotbase R\n\n\nFirst we create a simple scatterplot with x and y labels in base r.\n\n#simple ggplot plot with x and y axis labeled\nggplot(penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g,)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(x = \"Flipper Length (cm)\", y = \"Body Mass (kg)\",\n       title = \"Body Mass vs. Flipper Length\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan we compare different species in these plots?

Let’s color our points based on the species.\n\n# color dots by species\nplot(penguins$flipper_length_mm, penguins$body_mass_g,\n     xlab = \"Flipper Length (mm)\", ylab = \"Body Mass (g)\",\n     col = penguins$species) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy are colors specified differently in base R and ggplot?\n\n\n\n\nIn base R plotting, the color for each point is specified directly within the plot() function using the col argument. This argument can take a vector of colors, which will be applied to the points in the plot. In this example, we are passing the species information directly to the col argument to color the points based on the species.\nIn ggplot2, the aesthetics (aes) of the plot are defined within the aes() function. The color aesthetic is specified inside the aes() function to map the species variable to the colors of the points. This approach follows the grammar of graphics philosophy, where data properties are mapped to visual properties in a structured way.\nBoth methods allow us to compare different species in the plots by coloring the points based on the species. However, the ggplot2 approach is generally more flexible and powerful for creating complex visualizations.\n\n\n\n\nAnother way to change the colors in a ggplot–local aesthetics\nIn ggplot2, the aes() function is used to map data variables to visual properties (aesthetics) of the plot. The placement of the color specification can vary based on whether it is applied globally or locally.\n\nGlobal aesthetics apply to all geoms in the plot, and are added in the initial ggplot() call (or in a stand-alone aes() layer).\nLocal aesthetics apply only to the geom to which they are added.\n\nThis first plot produces the same output as our original plot.\n\nggplot(penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = species)) +\n  labs(x = \"Flipper Length (cm)\", y = \"Body Mass (kg)\",\n       title = \"Body Mass vs. Flipper Length\",\n       color = \"Species\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this second plot, the local aesthetic overrides the global one.\n\nggplot(penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = species)) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = flipper_length_mm)) + # local aesthetic applied here\n  labs(x = \"Flipper Length (cm)\", y = \"Body Mass (kg)\",\n       title = \"Body Mass vs. Flipper Length\",\n       color = \"Species\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s customize our plots!\nLet’s customize these plots some more! Here we challenge you to change the shapes of the points for each species, add a customized legend in the position of the plot we want, and change the size of the points.\nTake 5-10 minutes to try to figure out one or more of the changes we made to the plot:\n\nChange the shape of the points based on species.\nAdd custom colors for the different species.\nChange the position of the legend to make it more visually pleasing.\nAdd a subtitle to the figure.\n\nFeel free to try ggplot or base R, depending on your preference. Practice finding this information using:\n\nThe base r docs for the plot() function or ggplot2 docs\nUse Google to find informative articles online like this\nAsk a friend or instructor for help if you get stuck.\n\nFeel free to add your own touches to the figure, and experiment with changing the numbers and variables in the figure!\n\nggplotbase r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode used to make the plot–try on your own first!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Even more complex example with custom labels, colors, and fig legend position\nggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = species, shape = species), size = 3) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"darkorange\",\"purple\",\"cyan4\")) +\n  labs(title = \"Penguin size, Palmer Station LTER\",\n       subtitle = \"Flipper length and body mass for Adelie, Chinstrap and Gentoo Penguins\",\n       x = \"Flipper length (cm)\",\n       y = \"Body mass (kg)\") +\n  theme(legend.position = c(0.9, 0.1))\n\n#Similar figure using base R\nspecies_colors &lt;- c(\"darkorange\", \"purple\", \"cyan4\")\n\nplot(penguins$flipper_length_mm, penguins$body_mass_g,\n     xlab = \"Flipper Length (mm)\", ylab = \"Body Mass (g)\",\n     main = \"Penguin size, Palmer Station LTER\",\n     sub = \"Flipper length and body mass for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo Penguins\",\n     pch = as.numeric(penguins$species), # Assign shapes based on species\n     col = species_colors[penguins$species]) # Assign colors based on species\n\n# Add legend\nlegend(\"bottomright\", legend = levels(penguins$species),\n       col = species_colors, \n       pch = 1:3, #shape codes to legend\n       title = \"Penguin species\")",

We’ll display different plots with several new features to try, and you can use your plotting and researching skills to recreate them. This is a great opportunity to experiment and be creative. Remember, questions are always welcome.\n\nNumerical by categorical plots\nTry making some numerical by categorical plots on your own using this dataset! This example looks at body mass in each species, using “jittered” points. See if you can recreate this on your own!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint – a reminder of the basic syntax for boxplots\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplotbase r\n\n\n\n# ggplot boxplot of body mass values in each species\nggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = species, y = body_mass_g)) +\n  geom_boxplot(aes(color = species), width = 0.3) +\n  labs(x = \"Species\",\n       y = \"Body mass (g)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Base R boxplot of body mass values in each species\nboxplot(body_mass_g ~ species, data = penguins,\n        col = c(\"darkorange\", \"purple\", \"cyan4\"),\n        main = \"Body Mass by Penguin Species\",\n        xlab = \"Species\",\n        ylab = \"Body Mass (g)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplotbase r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to recreate this plot–try on your own first!\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat if we also want to see individual points in a distribution? We can add points with “jitter” – a small amount of random variation on the x-axis – to better visualize where the points fall.\nIn ggplot2, you can use the geom_jitter() function to add jittered points to your plot. This adds a small amount of random noise to each point, making it easier to see overlapping points.\n\n# overlay the raw data points using geom_jitter\nggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = species, y = body_mass_g)) +\n  geom_boxplot(aes(color = species), width = 0.3, show.legend = FALSE) +\n  geom_jitter(aes(color = species), alpha = 0.5, show.legend = FALSE, \n     position = position_jitter(width = 0.2)) +\n  labs(x = \"Species\",\n       y = \"Body mass (g)\")\n\nIn base R, you can achieve a similar effect using the jitter() function. This function adds a small amount of random variation to the data points, making overlapping points more distinguishable.\n\n# Create the boxplot\nboxplot(body_mass_g ~ species, data = penguins,\n        col = c(\"darkorange\", \"purple\", \"cyan4\"),\n        main = \"Body Mass by Penguin Species\",\n        xlab = \"Species\",\n        ylab = \"Body mass (g)\")\n\n# Add overlaid points (jittered). Factor controls the width of the points\\\n#cex controls their size, and pch controls the symbol\npoints(jitter(as.numeric(penguins$species), factor = 1.5),\n       penguins$body_mass_g,\n       pch = 16, cex = 0.8)\n\n# Add custom legend (optional)\nlegend(\"bottomright\", legend = levels(penguins$species),\n       fill = c(\"darkorange\", \"purple\", \"cyan4\"),\n       title = \"Penguin species\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlotting the distribution of a numerical variable\nIf we want to loot at the distribution of one numerical variable in detail, we could use a histogram.

Alternatively, you can use the binwidth argument to specify the width of each bin.\n\nggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins = 30) +\n  labs(x = \"Body Mass (g)\", y = \"Frequency\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = bill_depth_mm)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth=0.5) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn base R, you can change the number of bins in a histogram using the breaks argument in the hist() function. This argument allows you to specify the number of bins directly, or you can pass a vector of break points.\n\n#change the number of bins to your liking \nhist(penguins$bill_depth_mm, breaks = 30, main = \"Histogram of Penguin Bill Depth\", xlab = \"Bill Depth (mm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge plot\nCan we find the means of these distributions and plot the means on our histograms?

    "text": "Mini-Lesson: Introduction to facet_grid in ggplot2\n\nBackground:\nIn data visualization, particularly when dealing with complex datasets, it’s beneficial to compare subsets of data across different categories simultaneously. ggplot2 provides various functions for creating faceted plots, with facet_grid being a prominent choice for creating grids that can help in exploring interactions between variables.\n\n\nFaceting:\nFaceting refers to the strategy of splitting one plot into multiple plots based on a factor (or factors) included in the dataset. Each plot represents a level of the factor(s) and shares the same axis scaling and grids, which makes them easy to compare.\nThe facet_grid function creates a matrix of panels defined by row and column faceting variables. The general syntax is:\n\nfacet_grid(rows ~ cols)\n\nIf we just want to facet by rows or just by columns, replace that spot with a “.”.\n\n#facet by rows\nfacet_grid(rows ~ .)\n#facet by cols\nfacet_grid(. ~ cols)\n\nLets take some of the plots we made earlier and facet them by the categorical variable year!

Indexing, or accessing elements, subsets data based on numeric positions in a vector. You may remember this from the first class. Some things to be aware of when indexing:\n\nIndexing uses brackets. i.e. the 5th element in a vector will be returned if you run vector[5].\nIt’s helpful for getting several elements at once, or reordering data.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n# First, we'll make a vector to play with\nnames &lt;- c(\"rosalind\", \"marie\", \"barbara\")\n\n\n# if we print the output, we'd get:\nnames\n\n[1] \"rosalind\" \"marie\"    \"barbara\" \n\n\n\n# If we want to access the first name, we can use brackets and the position of the name in the vector:\nnames[1]\n\n[1] \"rosalind\"\n\n\n\n# This works with any position, for example the third name:\nnames[3]\n\n[1] \"barbara\"\n\n# You can index more than one position at a time too:\nnames[c(1,2)]\n\n[1] \"rosalind\" \"marie\"   \n\n# Changing the order of numbers you supply changes the order of names returned\nnames[c(2,1)]\n\n[1] \"marie\"    \"rosalind\"\n\n\n\n\nWorking with data frames\nThis works for two-dimensional structures too, like data frames and matrices. We’d just format it as: dataframe[row,column]. Let’s try it out:\n\n# Make a data frame\ndf &lt;- data.frame(\n  name = c(\"Rosalind Franklin\", \"Marie Curie\", \"Barbara McClintock\", \"Ada Lovelace\", \"Dorothy Hodgkin\", \n           \"Lise Meitner\", \"Grace Hopper\", \"Chien-Shiung Wu\", \"Gerty Cori\", \"Katherine Johnson\"),\n  field = c(\"DNA X-ray crystallography\", \"Radioactivity\", \"Genetics\", \"Computer Programming\", \"X-ray Crystallography\", \n            \"Nuclear Physics\", \"Computer Programming\", \"Experimental Physics\", \"Biochemistry\", \"Orbital Mechanics\"),\n  school = c(\"Cambridge\", \"Sorbonne\", \"Cornell\", \"University of London\", \"Oxford\", \n             \"University of Berlin\", \"Yale\", \"Princeton\", \"Washington University\", \"West Virginia University\"),\n  date_of_birth = c(\"1920-07-25\", \"1867-11-07\", \"1902-06-16\", \"1815-12-10\", \"1910-05-12\", \n                    \"1878-11-07\", \"1906-12-09\", \"1912-05-31\", \"1896-08-15\", \"1918-08-26\"),\n  working_region = c(\"Western Europe\", \"Western Europe\", \"North America\", \"Western Europe\", \"Western Europe\", \"Western Europe\", \"North America\", \"North America\", \"North America\",  \"North America\")\n)\n\n# To get the first row:\ndf[1,]\n\n               name                     field    school date_of_birth\n1 Rosalind Franklin DNA X-ray crystallography Cambridge    1920-07-25\n  working_region\n1 Western Europe\n\n# or the first column: \ndf[,1]\n\n [1] \"Rosalind Franklin\"  \"Marie Curie\"        \"Barbara McClintock\"\n [4] \"Ada Lovelace\"       \"Dorothy Hodgkin\"    \"Lise Meitner\"      \n [7] \"Grace Hopper\"       \"Chien-Shiung Wu\"    \"Gerty Cori\"        \n[10] \"Katherine Johnson\" \n\n# for specific cells: \ndf[2,3]\n\n[1] \"Sorbonne\"\n\n# We can use the column name instead of numbers:\ndf[2,\"school\"]\n\n[1] \"Sorbonne\"\n\n# We can do the same thing by using a dollar sign:\ndf$name\n\n [1] \"Rosalind Franklin\"  \"Marie Curie\"        \"Barbara McClintock\"\n [4] \"Ada Lovelace\"       \"Dorothy Hodgkin\"    \"Lise Meitner\"      \n [7] \"Grace Hopper\"       \"Chien-Shiung Wu\"    \"Gerty Cori\"        \n[10] \"Katherine Johnson\" \n\n# We can also give a list of columns\n# which return in the order provided\ndf[,c(\"school\",\"name\")]\n\n                     school               name\n1                 Cambridge  Rosalind Franklin\n2                  Sorbonne        Marie Curie\n3                   Cornell Barbara McClintock\n4      University of London       Ada Lovelace\n5                    Oxford    Dorothy Hodgkin\n6      University of Berlin       Lise Meitner\n7                      Yale       Grace Hopper\n8                 Princeton    Chien-Shiung Wu\n9     Washington University         Gerty Cori\n10 West Virginia University  Katherine Johnson\n\n\n\n\nStandard data formats and Tidy\nThat data, and most two-dimensional data sets (data frames, matrices, etc.) is often organized the similarly:\n\nEach variable is its own column\nEach observation is its own row\nEach value is a single cell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Hadley Wickham’s R for Data Science, 1st Edition\n\n\n\n\nThis follows the tidy data style, an approach to handling data in R that aims to be clear and readable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTidiest Universe\n\n\n\nThe bundle of tidy-associated packages is called the tidyverse, and it’s a 🔥 hot-topic 🔥 in the R world. In fact, ggplot is a package that you have already used that is part of the tidyverse! Most data wrangling problems can be solved with tidy or base (default) R functions. This can lead to some headaches for beginners, as there are multiple ways to accomplish the same thing!\n\n\n\n\ndplyr verbs\nOne of the most popular tidyverse packages, dplyr, offers a suite of helpful and readable functions for data manipulation. Let’s get started with how it can help you see your data:\n\n\n- The library is already synchronized with the lockfile.\n\n\n\ndplyr::glimpse(df)\n\nRows: 10\nColumns: 5\n$ name           &lt;chr&gt; \"Rosalind Franklin\", \"Marie Curie\", \"Barbara McClintock…\n$ field          &lt;chr&gt; \"DNA X-ray crystallography\", \"Radioactivity\", \"Genetics…\n$ school         &lt;chr&gt; \"Cambridge\", \"Sorbonne\", \"Cornell\", \"University of Lond…\n$ date_of_birth  &lt;chr&gt; \"1920-07-25\", \"1867-11-07\", \"1902-06-16\", \"1815-12-10\",…\n$ working_region &lt;chr&gt; \"Western Europe\", \"Western Europe\", \"North America\", \"W…\n\n\nWith the glimpse function we see that this is a data frame with 3 observations and 3 variables. We can also see the type of each variable and the first few values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\ndplyr functions have a lot in common:\n\nThe first argument is always a data frame\nThe following arguments typically specify which columns to operate on, using the variable names (without quotes)\nThe output is always a new data frame\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Joshua Ebner’s A Quick Introduction to Dplyr\n\n\n\n\nThe dplyr package has a set of functions that are used to manipulate data frames (you may see these referred to as “verbs”, and it may also be helpful to think of them as verbs performing an action on your dataframe). These functions can either act on rows (e.g. filter out specific rows by some condition) or columns (e.g. select columns XYZ). There are also functions for working with groups (e.g. group rows by what values they have in a column with group_by).\n\nrowscolumnsgroups\n\n\nThe most important verbs that operate on rows of a dataset are filter(), which changes which rows are present without changing their order, and arrange(), which changes the order of the rows without changing which are present. Both functions only affect the rows, and the columns are left unchanged. We’ll also discuss distinct() which finds rows with unique values but unlike arrange() and filter() it can also optionally modify the columns.\nMore information about functions like this can be found here.\n\n\nThere are four important verbs that affect the columns without changing the rows: mutate() creates new columns that are derived from the existing columns, select() changes which columns are present, rename() changes the names of the columns, and relocate() changes the positions of the columns.\nMore information about functions like this can be found here.\n\n\ngroup_by allows you to create groups using more than one variable.\nsummarize works on grouped objects and allows you to calculate a single summary statistic, reducing the data frame to have a single row for each group.\nThe slice family of functions allows you to extract specific rows within each group\nMore information about functions like this can be found here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\ndplyr verbs work great as a team!\n\n\nAlthough these were basic examples, hopefully you feel a little more confident about working with vectors, and data frames using dplyr verbs to clean and manipulate data. Happy Wrangling!\n\n\nFunctions on functions\n\nAn introduction to pipes\nData scientists often want to make many changes to their data at one time. Typically, this means using more than one function at once. However, the way we’ve been writing our scripts so far would make for some very confusing looking code.\nFor example, let’s use dplyr functions to perform two operations on our data set of scientists: filter for those born after 1900 and then arrange them by date of birth.\n\nWriting it as separate stepsCombining functions in one lineUsing pipes to clean up the code\n\n\nHere we first filter and then arrange. Note that we are creating an intermediate variable in between the steps.\n\n# Filtering for scientists born after 1900\nfiltered_data &lt;- filter(df, as.Date(date_of_birth) &gt; as.Date(\"1900-01-01\"))\n\n# Arranging the filtered data by date of birth\narranged_data &lt;- arrange(filtered_data, date_of_birth)\n\n\n\nWe can do the same thing without creating an intermediate variable. It’s more compact but can start to get confusing if we add more functions.\n\narranged_data &lt;- arrange(filter(df, as.Date(date_of_birth) &gt; as.Date(\"1900-01-01\")), date_of_birth)\n\n\n\nThe pipe operator, |&gt;, is a tool that can help make the script more readable. It allows us to pass the result of one function directly into the next. Think of it as saying, “and then..”\nLet’s dissect our goal: filter for those born after 1900 and then arrange them by date of birth.\nfilter is doing the filter for… part\narrange is doing the arrange them… part\nand the pipe, |&gt;, is going to do the and then… part.\n\n# Using pipes\narranged_data &lt;- df |&gt;\n  filter(as.Date(date_of_birth) &gt; as.Date(\"1900-01-01\")) |&gt;\n  arrange(date_of_birth)\n\nOnce you’re comfortable with this style, you should be able to read it as: Take data and then filter by DoB and then arrange by DoB. This helps keep our code both clean and readable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThere are two pipe operators: |&gt; and %&gt;%. They work almost the exact same way. %&gt;% is from the magrittr package and was the only way to pipe before version R 4.1.0. You may see %&gt;%more frequently in code from previous lab members.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlaceholders\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Placeholder operator allows more control over where the LHS (left hand side) is placed into the RHS (right hand side) of the pipe operator.\n\n%&gt;%|&gt;\n\n\n%&gt;% uses . as its placeholder operator. In addition to this, you may use . multiple times on the RHS\n\n3 %&gt;% head(x = letters, n = .)\n\n[1] \"a\" \"b\" \"c\"\n\n3 %&gt;% sum(2, ., .)\n\n[1] 8\n\n\n\n\n|&gt; uses _ as its placeholder operator. However, the _ placeholder must only be used once and the argument must be named\n\n3 |&gt; head(x = letters, n = _)\n\n[1] \"a\" \"b\" \"c\"\n\n\n\n#3 |&gt; sum(2, _)#| #| #| #| \n\n\n#add3 &lt;- function(x, y, z) x + y + z\n#3 |&gt; add3(2, y = _, z = _)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRight Hand Side (RHS)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%&gt;%|&gt;\n\n\n%&gt;% can take a function name on the RHS\n\nletters %&gt;% head\n\n[1] \"a\" \"b\" \"c\" \"d\" \"e\" \"f\"\n\n\n\n\nThe RHS for |&gt; must be a function with ()\n\n#letters |&gt; head\n\n\nletters |&gt; head()\n\n[1] \"a\" \"b\" \"c\" \"d\" \"e\" \"f\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnonymous Functions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%&gt;%|&gt;\n\n\n%&gt;% can take expressions in curly braces {}\n\nx &lt;- 10\n5 %&gt;% {x + .}\n\n[1] 15\n\n\n\n\n|&gt; must have a function call on RHS\n\n#x &lt;- 10\n#5 |&gt; {x + _}\n\n\n5 |&gt; {function(y) x + y}()\n\n[1] 15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo summarize, %&gt;% is slightly more lenient than |&gt; when it comes to the Placeholder operator, the Right Hand Side (RHS) and Anonymous functions.",

The Tour de France is an annual multi-week bicycle race held primarily in France. The race comprises 21 stages held over 23 days. Each stage covers a different area of France and different terrain; and the course changes each year. There are 20 to 22 teams that participate each year and each team is made up of 8 riders.\nThe year is 2024 and this year’s tour, as in prior years, is a nail-biter between Team UAE’s Tadej Pogačar and Team VLAB’s Jonas Vingegaard. So far, 14 stages and nearly 1,300 miles have been completed and Jonas is trailing his rival Tadej by just one minute and fourteen seconds. Stage 15 is tomorrow, and Team VLAB wants to know if Jonas has a chance to make up time and win the Tour. To help determine race strategy, Team VLAB wants you to analyze historical trends.\n\n\n\nPHOTO: CHRIS AULD/VELO",

Use the rename() function to rename columns in a consistent format.\nTake another look at the rider history data. You may notice that some columns are duplicative: we have two different columns for total time and time gap, just in different units. But do these contain the same data? It’s entirely possible that there are discrepancies and that could be something to flag before we begin analysis.\n\nFirst, use the function str_extract() to place the hours, minutes, and seconds into three separate columns. Convert the hours and minutes columns to seconds using mutate()\nCreate a new column called new_total_seconds summing the new hours, minutes, and seconds columns.\nThen, use filter() to identify rows where the total seconds you just calculated doesn’t match the one in the TotalSeconds column originally provided in the data.

Pick at least one of the analysis questions below and make a plot that helps answer the question. It may also be helpful to calculate a summary statistic (e.g. mean).\n\nHave winners of the Tour gotten faster over time?\nHas the average speed per year gotten faster over time? This would be the average speed of peloton.\nHow does Jonas’ average speed compare this year to prior years? What about Tadej’s?\n\nBONUS if you like scandal!

We have provided links to data that is publicly available for download, as well as some related publications that may give you more information about the data.\nThese datasets were chosen because we thought they represented a good variety in the different kinds of wrangling and visualization challenges you might encounter with your own data in the future: we have highlighted a few specific R skills that some of these datasets were meant to challenge you on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe datasets are presented roughly in order of increasing wrangling complexity. Though you should have most of the basic skills you need to wrangle and analyze these datasets, we have specifically provided some code to aid you in certain wrangling tasks for some of the later datasets: see the “Analysis ideas and hints” callout for each dataset.\n\n\nFor each dataset, we have provided a description of the research question/data collection methods, metadata, and the first few lines of each dataset. Read through these descriptions and work on the dataset you find most interesting. Feel free to work with a partner!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut I thought this was HTLTCode, not HTLTScience!\n\n\n\nTo get the most out of today’s activities, we highly encourage you to practice going through the whole data analysis workflow as independently as you can, using your notes and practicing your Googling skills to develop your own research questions and analysis ideas for these datasets.\nThat said, we have prepared some example research questions and figures for each dataset to get everyone started, so you can decide if you’d rather focus more on coding or science-ing for each dataset. These research questions are split into “easier” and “harder” coding challenges, with “harder” challenges generally involving slightly more wrangling: all datasets have a pre-filled project template in the same location as the blank template document that will explain the code used to produce the example figures.\nThus, based on your comfort level, you can decide how much of the data analysis workflow you want to try independently today. You can:\n\nJust recreate our figures,\nDevelop your own analysis and figures to answer our research questions, or\nDevelop your own research questions, analysis, and figures.\n\n\n\n\nAvida digital evolution dataset\nRelated publications1\nSkills to practice: working with multiple files, pivoting\nBackground: The following data was generated using Avida-ED, an online educational application that allows one to study the dynamics of evolutionary processes. Digital, asexually-reproducing organisms known as “Avidians” can be placed into something akin to a virtual Petri dish to evolve in, and one can manipulate parameters such as mutation rate, resource availability, and dish size to study how those factors affect the evolution of the population.\nYour friend needs your help to analyze their Avida-Ed data. They designed a series of experiments around a mutant Avidian that gets an energy bonus when the sugar “nanose” is present and a wildtype Avidian that does not. They wanted to see how competition and resource availability affect the population dynamics of these Avidians.\nYour friend grew either the wildtype only, mutant only, or both populations together (competition) in the following 3 environments:\n\nMinimal (no additional sugars present)\nSelective (only nanose present)\nRich (nanose and additional sugars present)\n\n\n\n\nAvida experiment setup\n\n\nHelp your friend get started with some of the exploratory data analysis. What relationships can you find between genotype, competition, and resource availability?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData overview\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData previewColumn metadata\n\n\nData for avida_wildtype.csv shown only:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nupdate\ncondition\nminimal_avg.fitness\nminimal_avg.offspring.cost\nminimal_avg.energy.acq.rate\nminimal_pop.size\nselective_avg.fitness\nselective_avg.offspring.cost\nselective_avg.energy.acq.rate\nselective_pop.size\nrich_avg.fitness\nrich_avg.offspring.cost\nrich_avg.energy.acq.rate\nrich_pop.size\n\n\n\n\n0\nwildtype-only\n0.3587786\n131\n47\n1\n0.2486772\n189\n47\n1\n0.3587786\n131\n47\n1\n\n\n1\nwildtype-only\n0.3587786\n131\n47\n1\n0.2486772\n189\n47\n1\n0.3587786\n131\n47\n1\n\n\n2\nwildtype-only\n0.3587786\n131\n47\n1\n0.2486772\n189\n47\n1\n0.3587786\n131\n47\n1\n\n\n3\nwildtype-only\n0.3587786\n131\n47\n1\n0.2486772\n189\n47\n1\n0.3587786\n131\n47\n1\n\n\n4\nwildtype-only\n0.3587786\n131\n47\n2\n0.2486772\n189\n47\n1\n0.3587786\n131\n47\n2\n\n\n5\nwildtype-only\n0.3587786\n131\n47\n2\n0.2486772\n189\n47\n1\n0.3587786\n131\n47\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn\nType\nDescription\nValues\n\n\n\n\nupdate\ninteger\nTime elapsed\nRanges 0-300\n\n\ncondition\ncharacter\nTesting conditions (single population or competition)\nBased off csv: wildtype-only, mutant-only, competition\n\n\nmedia_avg.fitness\nnumeric\nAverage individual reproductive success in specified media\nRanges 0-1\n\n\nmedia_avg.offspring.cost\nnumeric\nAverage individual reproductive cost in specified media\n\n\n\nmedia_avg.energy.acq.rate\nnumeric\nAverage individual rate of energy acquisition from environment in specified media\n\n\n\nmedia_pop.size\ninteger\nPopulation size in specified media\nRanges 0-900\n\n\n\nAll population measurements were determined for minimal, selective, and rich media.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis ideas and hints\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis hintsExample questionsExample figures\n\n\n\nWhich files have the pieces of data you need?

Though most current knowledge about heat-health risks are known and implemented at the neighborhood level, less is known about individual experiences of heat, which can vary due to differences in access to cooling resources and activity patterns.\nTo further investigate, the Central Arizona-Pheonix Long-Term Ecological Research Program (CAP-LTER) recruited participants from 5 Pheonix-area neighborhoods to wear air temperature sensors that recorded their individually-experienced temperatures (IETs) as they went about their daily activities.\nWhat relationships can you find between individual activity, temperature, and neighborhood?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData overview\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData previewColumn metadata\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubject.ID\nperiod\ntemperature\n\n\n\n\n1A\nSat, 8pm-12am\n25.14447\n\n\n1P\nSat, 8pm-12am\n26.77962\n\n\n1E\nSat, 8pm-12am\n27.21875\n\n\n1B\nSat, 8pm-12am\n26.79175\n\n\n2N\nSat, 8pm-12am\nNA\n\n\n3A\nSat, 8pm-12am\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn\nType\nDescription\nValues\n\n\n\n\nSubject.ID\ncharacter\nSubject identifier where number (1-5) corresponds to neighborhood\n1=Coffelt, 2=Encanto-Palmcroft, 3=Garfield, 4=Thunderhill, 5=Power Ranch\n\n\nperiod\ncharacter\n4 hour measurement period\nweekday, period\n\n\ntemperature\nnumeric\n4 hour average of IET during specified period\nCelcius\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis ideas and hints\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis hintsExample questionsExample figures\n\n\n\nWe recommend using functions in the stringr package from the tidyverse to parse the strings, particularly str_sub() and str_split_fixed().\n\ne.g. If you had a vector x containing a bunch of 2 character codes (XX), you could extract the first character with str_sub(x, 1, 1).\ne.g. If you had a vector x containing information in the format first-second-third, you could extract that first chunk with str_split_fixed(x, \"-\", n=3)[,1].\n\nR has some “counting” functions such as length() and n(): how could you get unique counts?
