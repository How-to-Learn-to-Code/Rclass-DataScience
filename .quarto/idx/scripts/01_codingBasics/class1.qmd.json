This is analogous to thinking \"learning molecular biology\" is just \"learning pipetting.\"\n>\n> --- Vince Buffalo\n\nIn Vince's quote above, replace \"bioinformatics\" with \"coding.\"\n\nOur goal for How to Learn to Code is to familiarize students with the R programming language and RStudio environment, equip students with the skills and knowledge to wrangle, visualize, and analyze data, and to provide a foundation for more advanced coding skills.\n\nIn Module 1: Coding Basics, we will cover:\n\n-   Variables\n-   Reproducible environments\n-   RStudio IDE\n-   Various R script and file formats\n-   R syntax\n-   Commenting, writing, and executing code\n-   Functions\n-   Data structures in R\n-   Data types in R\n-   Manipulating data types and structures\n\nCurious about what the rest of the classes will look like?\n\n-   Module 1: Coding Basics\n\n-   Module 2: Data Visualization\n\n-   Module 3: Data Wrangling\n\n-   Module 4: Project Management (and applying everything you've learned to a real-world dataset!)\n\n## Objectives of Coding Basics: Class 1\n\n-   Be able to create a variable, define what it is, and follow good variable naming practices\n\n-   Understand basic data structures in R\n\n-   Understand basic data types in R\n\n-   Perform basic manipulations with data structures and types\n\n-   Describe benefits of knowing how to code\n\n## Exploring a dataset\n\nR has a few built in datasets that we can use until we cover installing/loading packages and reading in data files. For the following examples we will use a built-in dataset in R called \"iris\" that has some measurements across a few species of flowers. It is one of the most popular built-in datasets in R. We will use this dataset to explore key coding concepts: **variables**, **data types**, and **functions**.\n\nFirst, let's take a look at the dataset. You can view the dataset multiple ways. Let's try one--copy the below line of code into your console and run it.\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\niris\n```\n\nAs we can see, this dataset has a few columns of numbers, in addition to the species. Let's try a few other ways to look at this dataset. As you try each method, think about what is different about each method. When would one method be more beneficial than another?\n\n```{r}\nhead(iris)\n```\n\n```{r}\nView(iris)\n```\n\nYou are probably already thinking of questions you need the answers to in order to familiarize yourself with this dataset. What does each row represent? Each column? How many observations (rows) do we have? What is the average petal length? Think about other questions you may want to ask. Think about how you would go about answering those questions with what you already know. Maybe you'd count each row on your screen to get the number of observations, or copy the values under `Petal.Length` into your phone calculator to calculate the mean. By the end of this class, you'll be able to do all those things very quickly in R!\n\n## Variables\n\nA variable is a named space in your computer's memory which can be referenced and manipulated. It's sort of a name you give \"something\", and that something can be just about anything.\n\n![https://mclark45.medium.com/variables-8d0ba47d9694](class1-files/variables.png)\n\nVariables in R are created (assigned) using an arrow: `<-` The variable name always goes on the left, and the thing being assigned to that variable on the right. For example:\n\n```{r}\ngreeting <- \"Hello\"\nanimal <- \"panda\"\nage <- 51\n```\n\nThe value something is assigned to is often referred to as the variable name. For example, the variable name of `\"Hello\"` is `greeting` . We used really basic variable names--just letters, that are real words, all lowercase. Of course, there are other ways to name variables too! Play around with variable names. Try using uppercase letters, symbols, and numbers. What works, and what doesn't? Come up with some rules for variable naming. Here's some variable naming ideas to get you started:\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\nGrEeTiNg <- \"Hello\"\n5greeting <- \"Hello\"\ngreeting.5 <- \"Hello\"\ngreeting@5 <- \"Hello\"\n```\n\nNow that you know some general rules for variable naming, we can refer to the [Style Guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html#syntax) for \"proper\" variable/object naming. Update your variable naming rule to include the preferred style for variable names according to the Style Guide.\n\nAnd now that we know how to properly name variables, assign the iris dataset to a variable!\n\n```{r}\niris_dataset_copy <- iris\n```\n\n## Data types\n\nAs you probably know from your own work, data can come in many forms. You can classify dragons as either \"purple\" or \"green\" and also record the number of spines on their backs as numeric types (15, 27). Data types are important to understand in R because the type of data impacts what you can do with that data. For example, it wouldn't make sense to calculate a mean for the dragon color, but it would for the number of back spines.\n\nIn R, we will focus on three basic data types that are used specify the type of data stored in a variable (there are a few more, but you probably won't ever run into them): **character, numeric,** and **logical.**\n\n**Character:** A character represents a string value. This can be anything from a single letter to entire paragraphs. Examples include `“a”, “B”, “c is third”, \"5\"`\n\n**Numeric:** A decimal value. Examples include `1.0, 3.1415926535`.\n\n**Logical:** Logical data types have only two possible values: `TRUE` or `FALSE`.\n\nSo far, we have learned about basic data structures (vectors, matrices, etc.) and basic data types (numeric, character, logical). Now, we want to start manipulating or *doing things* to them that can be helpful.\n\n## Converting Data Types\n\nFor example, sometimes when we read in data from a file, numbers can appear as strings of characters rather than a \"numeric\" type.\n\n```{r}\nmy_numbers <- c(\"4\", \"2\", \"7\", \"10\")\nprint(my_numbers)\n```\n\nHow can we tell? Because the numbers above are in quotations, indicating that they are of the `character` type and R is interpreting them as text. Before doing any math or further analysis with these data points, it's a good idea to convert them to the `numeric` type first.\n\n```{r}\nmy_numbers <- as.numeric(my_numbers)\nprint(my_numbers)\n```\n\nNote that the quotations are now gone. Now, we can do basic (or more advanced) calculations like the ones below.\n\n```{r}\n# Get minimum out of a list of values\nmin(my_numbers)\n```\n\n```{r}\n# Get maximum out of a list of values\nmax(my_numbers)\n```\n\n```{r}\n# Get average (mean) out of a list of values\nmean(my_numbers)\n```\n\nWe can also sort this list of values to go from smallest to largest. After doing so, the smallest value will be first in the list and the largest value will be last.\n\n```{r}\nmy_numbers <- sort(my_numbers)\nmy_numbers\n```\n\nWe can reverse the order to go from largest to smallest. There is an option using the `sort` function to do this.\n\n```{r}\nmy_numbers <- sort(my_numbers, decreasing = TRUE)\nmy_numbers\n```\n\n## Accessing parts of a list\n\nOne thing we'll be doing a lot of is looking at parts of our data. For example, we might want to look at individual items in a vector. These items could be numbers or characters.\n\n```{r}\nmy_data <- c(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\", \"F\")\nmy_data\n```\n\nIn this case, let's say I'm really interested in that \"E\" and want to pull it out separately from the rest of the data. I can do that with \"indexing\". Here, I can tell that it's the 5th item in the list, so I can extract it using the following:\n\n```{r}\nmy_data[5]\n```\n\nWe can also extract multiple items. If we wanted \"D\", \"E\", and \"F\", we can get all the values from item 4 (\"D\") to item 6 (\"F\").\n\n```{r}\nmy_data[4:6]\n```\n\nLet's say we forgot to include some of our data and now we want to add it to this list. We can update `my_data` to also include these values.\n\n```{r}\nmy_data <- c(my_data, \"G\", \"H\", \"I\")\nmy_data\n```\n\nBefore we move on, let's cover creating vectors. We already did this several times above, but didn't discuss it. Typically, we'll want to make vectors of numbers (e.g. our data values) or vectors of characters (e.g. labels for our data). Depending on whether we use quotes or not, R will interpret them as either numeric vectors or character vectors.\n\n```{r}\n# Numeric vector\nnumeric_vector <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\nnumeric_vector\n\n# Character vector\ncharacter_vector <- c(\"apple\", \"banana\", \"orange\")\ncharacter_vector\n```\n\nRemember the iris dataset from earlier? Let's return to it to cover extracting some of the rows or columns from this data.\n\nWe can access specific columns in one of two ways. Typically, we will want to access it by the name of the column. We do this using the name of the data frame, followed by the dollar sign, and finally the name of the column. For example:\n\n```{r}\niris$Petal.Length\n```\n\nIf we knew which column it was (or it wasn't named), we can also use indexing. Inside the brackets, we will need to indicate which \\[row , column\\] we want from this data frame. Since we want all the rows, we will leave the \"row\" blank. We can see that the Petal.Length was the 3rd column.\n\n```{r}\niris[, 3]\n```\n\nLet's say we didn't care the exact measurement of the Petal.Length of these flowers. We only cared whether they were \"big\" or not, and let's say that \"big\" is a Petal.Length of greater than 5.\n\n```{r}\niris$Petal.Length > 5\n```\n\nSome of them are \"big\" (with values of TRUE) and many of them are \"small\" (with values of FALSE). We can add this information to our dataset by making another column. Similar to how we extracted this column, we can also make a new one (with a name of our choice).\n\n```{r}\niris$BigPetals <- iris$Petal.Length > 5\n```\n\nAnd now it is added to our dataset.\n\n```{r}\n#| class: output\niris\n```\n\n## Functions\n\nA function is a block of code that does a task. It only executes that task when it is called/executed. Using a function in R always follows the same basic format:\n\n`function_name(arguments)`\n\nThe arguments are passed to the function, i.e. they are values that the function will manipulate. Functions can be built into R, included in packages, or you can write your own.\n\nFunctions can do very basic tasks:\n\n```{r}\nprint(\"Hello world!\")\n```\n\nOr more complex tasks, where multiple arguments are required, each separated by a comma:\n\n```{r}\nsubstr(x = \"Hello world!\", start = 2, stop = 4)\n```\n\nWe have already been using functions throughout this class--some examples include `sort()`, `min()`, and `max()`.\n\nWe will be using functions all the time in How to Learn to Code, but for today just know what a function is and what an argument is. Whenever you use a function, it's important to ensure you understand what it's doing: are you getting the expected result? Are you using the input arguments correctly? That is not only crucial for learning how to code, but how to think like a coder.\n\n## I already need help!\n\nSince this is a built-in dataset, we can get some help. Try running the code below:\n\n```{r}\n?iris\n?mean()\n```\n\nAdding a `?` before the name of a function or data frame (built-in or from a package) pulls up a help file in the Help tab of the Output pane. If you aren't sure what a function does, this should be your first step.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":true,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","number-sections":false,"toc":true,"toc-depth":4,"output-file":"class1.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","editor":"visual","theme":"cosmo","title":"R Coding Basics","subtitle":"Coding Basics, Day 1","author":"Matthew Sutcliffe, Madeline Gillman, JP Flores"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}},"pdf":{"execute":{"fig-width":5.5,"fig-height":3.5,"fig-format":"pdf","fig-dpi":300,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":true,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"pdf","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":true,"merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"pdf-engine":"xelatex","standalone":true,"variables":{"graphics":true,"tables":true},"default-image-extension":"pdf","to":"pdf","output-file":"class1.pdf"},"language":{},"metadata":{"block-headings":true,"editor":"visual","documentclass":"scrreprt","title":"R Coding Basics","subtitle":"Coding Basics, Day 1","author":"Matthew Sutcliffe, Madeline Gillman, JP Flores"},"extensions":{"book":{}}}}}
